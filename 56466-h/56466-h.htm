<div class="i0">As it came leaping on the dark unguarded</div>
<div class="i2">Silence of midnight to the door of the ear:</div>
<div class="i0">And finding the warm passages unwarded</div>
<div class="i2">Sped up the spiral stair, and mounted near</div>
<div class="i0">To where in unseen rooms the delicate sprite</div>

<div class="i2">Heart-thrills that shoot through blackness like a star.</div>

<div class="i2">My heart for sorrow of the sadness there:</div>
<div class="i0">But now her face was lit with joy, her eyes</div>
<div class="i0">Were eager messengers of her surprise</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>Clothed was she like a nun, and yet her vesture</div>

<div class="i2">As gamesome as the childhood in her face,</div>
<div class="i0">That I had seen so long downcast and sad,</div>
<div class="i0">Robbed of the happy birthright which she had,</div>
<div class="i2">Which earth may steal away but not replace.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">There is no sorrow like the slow heart-searing,</div>
<div class="i2">When phantoms bred of earth spring up between</div>
<div class="i0">Two loving hearts, who grew to their endearing,</div>
<div class="i2">When all their pushing tendrils yet were green:</div>
<div class="i0">No time-struck ruin is so sad to see</div>
<div class="i0">As youth’s disease: than thus, O Love, to be,</div>
<div class="i2">’Twere better for thy honour not to have been.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Had I not seen the servitude of folly,</div>

<div class="i0">Afraid to turn again and look behind,</div>
<div class="i0">Lest truth should flame and overwhelm the mind,</div>
<div class="i2">Fanning her red regret of old delights.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The mimicry of woe that is a trouble</div>

<div class="i0">To whom the joy is owed makes sorrow double</div>
<div class="i2">Seeing the debtor destitute that owes.</div>
<div class="i0">The tinselling of cruel bars, to blind</div>
<div class="i0">The cagèd bird to think the hand is kind</div>
<div class="i2">Which liberty denies and food bestows.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">From which I hurried as a beast from burning,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor cared in flying where my terror led;</div>
<div class="i0">Only beyond recall and past returning,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor now repent if then too far I fled.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">So long, dear life, as in my flesh thou reign’st</div>
<div class="i0">I will sin with thee rather than against,</div>
<div class="i2">Let me die living rather than live dead.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But neither is there human pleasure rarer</div>
<div class="i2">Than love’s renewal after long disdain,</div>
<div class="i0">Nor any touching tale for telling fairer</div>

<div class="i0">Such joy must happy souls beyond the grave,</div>
<div class="i0">If once again they meet, in Heaven have,</div>
<div class="i2">Without which all the joys of Heaven were vain.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">’Twas even thus she came and in my dreaming,</div>
<div class="i2">My pleasure was not less than Heaven’s may be:</div>
<div class="i0">The spiritual and unearthly seeming</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
<div class="i2">So far outdid a touched reality:</div>
<div class="i0">As glances sent in love do more than tell</div>
<div class="i0">What words can never phrase or utter well,</div>
<div class="i2">And which ’tis shame and blindness not to see.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But now the joy was mine, for gentle pity</div>
<div class="i2">Of her who wearily lived long alone</div>
<div class="i0">With mopes and mummers in a sensuous city</div>
<div class="i2">That held no passion equal to her own,</div>
<div class="i0">For gentle pity, I say, constrained me well,</div>
<div class="i0">As pains those separated souls they tell</div>
<div class="i2">Prepare for Heaven, and mould their hearts of stone.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But their sweet ecstasy is all abiding</div>
<div class="i2">And cannot pall with time nor tire nor fade,</div>
<div class="i0">Nor any more can day of death, dividing</div>
<div class="i2">Their earthborn loves, those happy haunts invade.</div>
<div class="i0">But joy for ever&mdash;if that joy compare</div>
<div class="i0">With my best joy on earth, may I be there!</div>
<div class="i2">Though even from that I shrink and am afraid.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now when I woke and thought upon this vision,</div>
<div class="i2">Wherein she smiled on me and I on her,</div>
<div class="i0">I could not quite be clear of all misprision</div>
<div class="i2">Who of us most was changed: or if it were</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
<div class="i0">The song I heard not&mdash;sleeping as I heard&mdash;</div>

<div class="i2">Regardless of his fond interpreter.</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
